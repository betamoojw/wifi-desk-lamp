# WiFi Controlled Desk Lamp - 3D models
**WiFi Controlled Desk Lamp** was inspired by [Twisted WiFi Controlled Desk Lamp](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4129249).

`WiFi_Controlled_Desk_Lamp_Core`, `WiFi_Controlled_Desk_Lamp_Twisted_Hull` and `WiFi_Controlled_Desk_Lamp_Twisted_Top` are fixed/tweaked models from original project. Other models were designed in [SketchUp Make 2017](https://help.sketchup.com/en/downloading-older-versions) or [OpenSCAD](https://www.openscad.org/).

## PCB in this project could be used in two ways:
